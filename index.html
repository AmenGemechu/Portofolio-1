                    The JABtalk mobile app takes the text-to-speech functionality one step further to assist 
                    those nonverbal adults and kids better communicate with a complex world. 
                    This app includes the ability to build complex sentences, 
                    organize words into user-defined categories, and import pictures and audio.

                    It even includes a backup feature to transfer setting to a new device. 
                    It basically transforms any Android device into an AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) device. 
                    The app is in its developmental stage, 
                    so that it improves functionality the more you use it. Available for Android users.

                    This mobile app not only maintains text and image clarity at high levels, 
                    it also includes an image stabilizer to assist those with shaky hands.
